Introducing AutoSlide: an ML-powered slideshow generator for all your crunch time needs. One of the most time consuming tasks when making slides is simply choosing good visuals to accomodate the presentation. With AutoSlide this will never be an issue again! AutoSlide automatically chooses images and adds them to your powerpoints based on the content of your uploaded slides. Try it out below!
